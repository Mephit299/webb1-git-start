        <h1>A Modest Proposal</h1>
        
        <p> preventing the children of poor people in Ireland,
            from being a burden on their parents or country,
            and for making them beneficial to the publick.</p>
            
            <p> Dr. Jonathan Swift</p>

    <p>It is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this great town,
        or travel in the country, when they see the streets, the roads, and
        cabbin-doors crowded with beggars of the female sex, followed by three,
        four, or six children, all in rags, and importuning every passenger for
        an alms. These mothers, instead of being able to work for their honest
        livelihood, are forced to employ all their time in stroling to beg
        sustenance for their helpless infants who, as they grow up, either turn
        thieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country, to fight
        for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes.</p>


    <p>I think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of
        children in the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of their
        mothers, and frequently of their fathers, is in the present deplorable
        state of the kingdom, a very great additional grievance; and therefore
        whoever could find out a fair, cheap and easy method of making these
        children sound and useful members of the commonwealth, would deserve so
        well of the publick, as to have his statue set up for a preserver of
        the nation.</p>

    <p>But my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for
        the children of professed beggars: it is of a much greater extent, and
        shall take in the whole number of infants at a certain age, who are
        born of parents in effect as little able to support them, as those who
        demand our charity in the streets.
